# ContactBridge

A contact management system with lead management (based on Customer Relationship Management System) features. This was developed by Jonas Rusiana, Gwyne Lobaton, and Reynette Lagat part of the partial requirements for CS121 Programming Languages. The implementation uses the Go Language for the central system (the backend). The interface was implemented via Go as well, with its standard library. This is part of a case study called “Imperative Standard: A Comprehensive Study on Implementing a CRUD Contact Management System with Imperative Programming”.

# Instructions

The backend and frontend must be used separately. They can be runned via the `go run .` command. Or by running them directly from the terminal: `.\client.exe` or `.\server.exe`.
