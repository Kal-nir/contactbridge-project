# ContactBridge

A contact management system with lead management (based on Customer Relationship Management System) features. This was developed by Jonas Rusiana, Gwyne Lobaton, and Reynette Lagat part of the partial requirements for CS121 Programming Languages. The implementation uses the Go Language for the central system (the backend). The interface implementation uses Flutter with Dart as the main language (multi-paradigm language with imperative features). This is part of a case study called “Imperative Standard: A Comprehensive Study on Implementing a CRUD Contact Management System with Imperative Programming”.

# Instructions

The backend and frontend must be used separately. They can be found in the releases as part of a zip file. However if you cloned the repository, they can be found in the build folders. The build folder should cater to different platforms, with each subfolders containing their own executable files. The backend must be runned from a termnial, and the frontend must be launched directly since it's a GUI.
